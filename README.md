# 5G-MATLAB-NETSIM-DRONE-SIMULATION
DISCRIPTION

Its basically a irrigation system in agricultural field in which a drone is used to detect the scarcity of the agricultural fields by flying over the fields and send the collected data back to ground control station for further actions ground control system apply image processing techniques and detect and mark the area which needs immediate irrigation.


STEPS TO RUN THE PEOJECT
just simply download the repository as zip file

open the matlab simulation folder and paste it in documents 

run the file uav test directly in matlab

it will create a matlab model as shown in matlab model jpg

you can give your own parameters according to your requirnments from matlab workspace

run the mobility file from workspace it will create a txt file for your netsim model

mobility file will be stored in the same folder which you saved in documents

unzip netsim folder 

open netsim and create a new workspace

upload netsim workplace file in netsim and run the simulation 

choose file base movement for your wireless devices

select the mobility file which you created from matlab 

you can moniter the connectivity and throughputs after running

changes will be according to your needs and save the simulation in netsim folder in C:

demo pics are aatached in the same folder
